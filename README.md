Introduction
Gold price prediction is an important task for investors and economists as gold is considered a safe-haven asset. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict future gold prices based on historical data and various economic indicators.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical gold prices along with other relevant financial and economic indicators. The dataset can be sourced from multiple financial data providers such as Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.

Data Fields
Date: Date of the observation
Gold Price: Historical gold prices (target variable)
USD Index: Value of the US Dollar Index
Inflation Rate: Inflation rate at the time
Crude Oil Prices: Prices of crude oil
Interest Rates: Interest rates
Stock Market Indices: Values of major stock market indices (e.g., S&P 500)
Features
The features used in the model include both numerical and categorical variables. Feature engineering and selection were performed to enhance model performance.

Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks
Installation

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data using preprocess.py.

bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py
Training Models: Train the models using train.py.

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using evaluate.py.

bash

Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²). The best-performing model was the XGBoost Regressor with the following results:

MAE: 15.32
RMSE: 28.45
R²: 0.87
Detailed results and comparison of all models can be found in the results/ directory.
